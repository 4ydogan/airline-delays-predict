### Airline Delays

Airplanes, which are accepted as the fastest means of transportation today, allow us to reach the places we want to go in less time. However, due to weather conditions and some technical problems, the planes may be delayed. These delays can last 15 minutes or more. Passengers boarding the plane may not care about delays of less than 15 minutes, but they will be annoyed by delays of more than 15 minutes. Passengers always wonder if their flights will be delayed. We want to train a model that calculates the probability of flight delays and take advantage of this model.
